// A System.Threading.Barrier is a synchronization primitive that enables multiple
// threads (known as participants) to work concurrently on an algorithm in phases.
// Each participant executes until it reaches the barrier point in the code. The barrier represents
// the end of one phase of work. When a participant reaches the barrier, it blocks until all participants
// have reached the same barrier. After all participants have reached the barrier, you can
// optionally invoke a post-phase action. This post-phase action can be used to perform actions
// by a single thread while all other threads are still blocked. After the action has been
// executed, the participants are all unblocked.
